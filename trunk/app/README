This file explains the logic behind the demo apps included in this Makefile
system.

Following are the apps and their location relative to this dir.

  Dir               App
  ---------------   ----------
  case/AB           AB
  case/AB/Abh       Abh
  case/CD           CD
  case/EF           EF
  CPP               hello
  gSrc/lex          count_words
  gSrc/lexAndYacc   calc

AB was written in C.

Abh shows that an app dir can have subdirs.

AB and Abh both use the $(ABG) variable, which is defined in HTMMM/lvars.mk.

CD uses one lib that AB and Abh use and one that AB and Abh don't use.

EF uses a shared lib (libcaseEF.so or libcaseEF.dll).

hello was written in C++.  The use of gcc and g++ is determined automatically
based on the source file extension.

count_words uses a C file and a generated C file from lex, which creates a
source file from a lex file.

calc uses a generated C file from lex and another one from yacc, which creates
both a source file and a header file from a yacc file.  Parallel make still
works even in this case of a prerequisite having multiple targets (normally a
target has one or more prerequisites).
