The calc app is from the IBM Systems Information Center:

  http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/systems/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.aix.genprogc/doc/genprogc/ie_prog_4lex_yacc.htm

The names of the lex and yacc files were changed because this Makefile system
does not support them having the same basename (the original names were calc.lex
and calc.yacc).

The following is from the URL listed above:

  This section contains example programs for the lex and yacc commands.
  Together, these example programs create a simple, desk-calculator program that
  performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.  This
  calculator program also allows you to assign values to variables (each
  designated by a single, lowercase letter) and then use the variables in
  calculations.

  ... after you start the program, the cursor moves to the line below the
  $(command prompt).  Then, enter numbers and operators as you would on a
  calculator.  When you press the Enter key, the program displays the result of
  the operation.  After you assign a value to a variable, as follows, the cursor
  moves to the next line.
  
    m=4 <enter>
    _
  
  When you use the variable in subsequent calculations, it will have the
  assigned value: 
  
    m+5 <enter>
    9
    _
