The spec files in this dir are for building binary RPMs.  They are not for building
source RPMs.

Also, the rpmbuild that uses the spec files does not use a .rpmmacros file.

%prep
In many cases you only need binary RPMs.  In these cases, you can save time by
not copying the source tree to $RPM_BUILD_DIR.

%build
Because the source tree is not copied, the build is started with "make -C
%{_topdir}/../..".  The T and RELDIR variables of the HTMMM Makefile system may
be used to do a partial build.  This is useful when your source tree is used for
building multiple RPMs.

%install
Like the build, the install uses "make -C %{_topdir}/../..".  The
$RPM_BUILD_ROOT is cleaned out before the install to ensure a fresh install for
every rpmbuild.

%clean
Since $RPM_BUILD_ROOT is cleaned out before the install, it is safe to do
nothing here.  Also, this allows you to examine the $RPM_BUILD_ROOT tree after
running rpmbuild.
