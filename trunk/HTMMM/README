The nonrecursive method is based on the work of Peter Miller and Robert
Mecklenburg (Ch. 6).  Also, the automatic dependency generation for the apps and
the libs is based on the same work of Robert Mecklenburg (Ch. 6).

The advanced method of fully-automatic dependency generation for the objects is
based on the work of Tom Tromey and Paul Smith.

The compiler-option dependency method is based on the Linux Kernel Makefile, as
described by Robert Mecklenburg (Ch. 11).

The OBJDIR method is based on the work of Paul Smith.

The command-echo management method is based on the Linux Kernel Makefile, as
described by Robert Mecklenburg (Ch. 11).

The debug mode method uses the GMSL and the GMD of John Graham-Cumming.
